    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet peaches and warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg are mixed together in this comforting dish to make a rich
        and flavourful filling. The topping, which can be a biscuit-like dough or a crispy, buttery crust, bakes to a
        golden brown colour, making every bite warm and satisfying.</p>
    <p>This Southern favourite is great for family get-togethers, summer cookouts, or just a cosy home-cooked treat. It
        goes well with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 fresh peaches, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter (melted)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the sliced peaches with sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, lemon juice, and
            cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Stir well to coat the peaches evenly.</li>
        <li>Pour the peach mixture into a greased baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour in the melted butter and mix lightly.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly over the peach filling—it will spread as it bakes.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the peaches are bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>Let the cobbler cool for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
